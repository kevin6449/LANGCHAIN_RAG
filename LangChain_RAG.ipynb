As our softwa re \\\\nbecomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The \\\\nrapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve \\\\nquickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this \\\\nOWASP Top 10.\\\\nA great deal of feedback was received during the creation of the OWASP Top 10 -2017, more than for any other equivalent \\\\nOWASP effort. This shows how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus how critical it is for \\\\nOWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of use cases.\\\\nAlthough the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to raise awareness amongst developers and managers, \\\\nit has become thede facto application security standard.\\\\nIn this release, issues and recommendations are written concisely and in a testable way to assist with the adoption of the \\\\nOWASP Top 10 in application security programs. We encourage large and high performing organizations to use the OWASP \\\\nApplication Security Verification Standard (ASVS) if a true standard is required, but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great \\\\nstart on the application security journey.\\\\nWe have written up a range of suggested next steps for different users of the OWASP Top 10, including What’s Next for \\\\nDevelopers , What’s Next for Security Testers , What’s Next for Organizations , which is suitable for CIOs and CISOs, and \\\\nWhat’s Next for Application Managers , which is suitable for application managers or anyone responsible for the lifecycle of \\\\nthe application.\\\\nIn the long term, we encourage all software development teams and organizations to create an application security program \\\\nthat is compatible with your culture and technology. These programs come in all shapes and sizes. Leverage your \\\\norganization\\'s existing strengths to measure and improve your application security program using the Software Assurance \\\\nMaturity Model .\\\\nWe hope that the OWASP Top 10 is useful to your application security efforts.

Two key differentiators from previous OWASP Top 10 \\\\nreleases are the substantial community feedback and extensive data assembled from dozens of organizations, possibly the \\\\nlargest amount of data ever assembled in the preparation of an application security standard. This provides us with \\\\nconfidence that the new OWASP Top 10 addresses the most impactful application security risks currently facing \\\\norganizations.\\\\nThe OWASP Top 10 -2017 is based primarily on 40+ data submissions from firms that specialize in application security and \\\\nan industry survey that was completed by over 500 individuals . This data spans vulnerabilities gathered from hundreds of \\\\norganizations and over 100,000 real -world applications and APIs. The Top 10 items are selected and prioritized according to \\\\nthis prevalence data, in combination with consensus estimates of exploitability, detectability, and impact.\\\\nA primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations about the \\\\nconsequences of the most common and most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic \\\\ntechniques to protect against these high risk problem areas, and provides guidance on where to go from here.\\\\nRoadmap for future activities\\\\nDon\\'t stop at 10 . There are hundreds of issues that could \\\\naffect the overall security of a web application as discussed \\\\nin the OWASP Developer\\'s Guide and the OWASP Cheat \\\\nSheet Series . These are essential reading for anyone \\\\ndeveloping web applications and APIs. Guidance on how to \\\\neffectively find vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs \\\\nis provided in the OWASP Testing Guide .\\\\nConstant change . The OWASP Top 10 will continue to \\\\nchange. Even without changing a single line of your \\\\napplication\\'s code, you may become vulnerable as new \\\\nflaws are discovered and attack methods are refined. \\\\nPlease review the advice at the end of the Top 10 in What\\'s \\\\nNext For Developers , Security Testers , Organizations , and \\\\nApplication Managers for more information.\\\\nThink positive . When you\\'re ready to stop chasing \\\\nvulnerabilities and focus on establishing strong application \\\\nsecurity controls, the OWASP Proactive Controls project \\\\nprovides a starting point to help developers build security \\\\ninto their application and the OWASP Application Security \\\\nVerification Standard (ASVS) is a guide for organizations \\\\nand application reviewers on what to verify.\\\\nUse tools wisely . Security vulnerabilities can be quite \\\\ncomplex and deeply buried in code. In many cases, the \\\\nmost cost -effective approach for finding and eliminating \\\\nthese weaknesses is human experts armed with advanced \\\\ntools. Relying on tools alone provides a false sense of \\\\nsecurity and is not recommended.\\\\nPush left, right, and everywhere . Focus on making \\\\nsecurity an integral part of your culture throughout your \\\\ndevelopment organization. Find out more in the OWASP \\\\nSoftware Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) .Attribution\\\\nWe\\'d like to thank the organizations that contributed their \\\\nvulnerability data to support the 2017 update. We received \\\\nmore than 40 responses to the call for data. For the first \\\\ntime, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full \\\\nlist of contributors is publicly available. We believe this is one \\\\nof the larger, more diverse collections of vulnerability data \\\\never publicly collected.\\\\nAs there are more contributors than space here, we have \\\\ncreated a dedicated page to recognize the contributions \\\\nmade. We wish to give heartfelt thanks to these \\\\norganizations for being willing to be on the front lines by \\\\npublicly sharing vulnerability data from their efforts. We hope \\\\nthis will continue to grow and encourage more organizations \\\\nto do the same and possibly be seen as one of the key \\\\nmilestones of evidence -based security. The OWASP Top 10 \\\\nwould not be possible without these amazing contributions.\\\\nA big thank you to the more than 500 individuals who took \\\\nthe time to complete the industry ranked survey. Your voice \\\\nhelped determine two new additions to the Top 10. The \\\\nadditional comments, notes of encouragement, \\\\nandcriticisms were all appreciated. We know your time is \\\\nvaluable and we wanted to say thanks.\\\\nWe would like to thank those individuals who have \\\\ncontributed significant constructive comments and time \\\\nreviewing this update to the Top 10. As much as possible, \\\\nwe have listed them on the ‘ Acknowledgements ’ page.\\\\nAnd finally, we\\'d like to thank in advance all the translators \\\\nout there who will translate this release of the Top 10 into \\\\nnumerous different languages, helping to make the OWASP \\\\nTop 10 more accessible to the entire planet.\\\\nI Introduction\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 3},page_content=\"4\\\\nWhat changed from 2013 to 2017?\\\\nChange has accelerated over the last four years, and the OWASP Top 10 needed to change. We\\'ve completely refactored the \\\\nOWASP Top 10, revamped the methodology, utilized a new data call process, worked with the community, re -ordered our risks, re -\\\\nwritten each risk from the ground up, and added references to frameworks and languages that are now commonly used.\\\\nOver the last few years, the fundamental technology and architecture of applications has changed significantly:\\\\n•Microservices written in node.js and Spring Boot are replacing traditional monolithic applications. Microservices come with their \\\\nown security challenges including establishing trust between microservices , containers, secret management, etc. Old code never \\\\nexpected to be accessible from the Internet is now sitting behind an API or RESTful web service to be consumed by Single Page\\\\nApplications (SPAs) and mobile applications. Architectural assumptions by the code, such as trusted callers, are no longer va lid.\\\\n•Single page applications, written in JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React, allow the creation of highly modular \\\\nfeature -rich front ends. Client -side functionality that has traditionally been delivered server -side brings its own security cha llenges.\\\\n•JavaScript is now the primary language of the web with node.js running server side and modern web frameworks such as \\\\nBootstrap, Electron, Angular, and React running on the client.\\\\nNew issues, supported by data:\\\\n•A4:2017 -XML External Entities (XXE) is a new category primarily supported by source code analysis security testing tools\\\\n(SAST) data sets.\\\\nNew issues, supported by the community:\\\\nWe asked the community to provide insight into two forward looking weakness categories. After over 500 peer submissions, and \\\\nremoving issues that were already supported by data (such as Sensitive Data Exposure and XXE), the two new issues are:\\\\n•A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization , which permits remote code execution or sensitive object manipulation on affected platforms.\\\\n•A10:2017 -Insufficient Logging and Monitoring , the lack of which can prevent or significantly delay malicious activity and breach \\\\ndetection, incident response, and digital forensics.\\\\nMerged or retired, but not forgotten:\\\\n•A4-Insecure Direct Object References and A7-Missing Function Level Access Control merged into A5:2017 -Broken Access \\\\nControl .\\\\n•A8-Cross -Site Request Forgery (CSRF) ,as many frameworks include CSRF defenses , it was found in only 5% of applications.\\\\n•A10-Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards , while found in approximately 8% of applications, it was edged out overall by XXE.\\\\nOWASP Top 10 -2013 \\\\uf0e8 OWASP Top 10 -2017\\\\nA1 –Injection \\\\uf0e8 A1:2017 -Injection\\\\nA2 –Broken Authentication and Session Management \\\\uf0e8 A2:2017 -Broken Authentication \\\\nA3 –Cross -Site Scripting (XSS) \\\\uf0ee A3:2017 -Sensitive Data Exposure\\\\nA4 –Insecure Direct Object References [Merged+A7] ∪A4:2017 -XML External Entities (XXE) [NEW]\\\\nA5 –Security Misconfiguration \\\\uf0ee A5:2017 -Broken Access Control [Merged]\\\\nA6 –Sensitive Data Exposure \\\\uf0ec A6:2017 -Security Misconfiguration\\\\nA7–Missing Function Level Access Contr [Merged+A4]∪A7:2017 -Cross -Site Scripting (XSS)\\\\nA8 –Cross -Site Request Forgery (CSRF) \\\\uf0fd A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization [NEW, Community]\\\\nA9 –Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities \\\\uf0e8 A9:2017 -Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\\\\nA10 –Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards \\\\uf0fd A10:2017 -Insufficient Logging &Monitoring [NEW,Comm .]\\\\nRN Release Notes\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 4},page_content=\\'5\\\\nWhat Are Application Security Risks?\\\\nAttackers can potentially use many different paths through your application to do harm to your business or organization. Each\\\\nof these paths represents a risk that may, or may not, be serious enough to warrant attention.\\\\nSometimes these paths are trivial to find and exploit, and sometimes they are extremely difficult. Similarly, the harm that i s \\\\ncaused may be of no consequence, or it may put you out of business. To determine the risk to your organization, you can \\\\nevaluate the likelihood associated with each threat agent, attack vector, and security weakness and combine it with an \\\\nestimate of the technical and business impact to your organization. Together, these factors determine your overall risk.\\\\nWeakness\\\\nAttackThreat\\\\nAgents\\\\nImpact\\\\n Weakness\\\\nAttackAttack\\\\nVectorsSecurity\\\\nWeaknessesTechnical\\\\nImpactsBusiness\\\\nImpacts\\\\nAttack\\\\nImpact\\\\nImpact\\\\nAsset\\\\nFunction\\\\nAsset\\\\nWeakness\\\\nControl\\\\nControl\\\\nControl\\\\n Weakness\\\\nSecurity\\\\nControls\\\\nRisk Application Security Risks\\\\nWhat’s MyRisk?\\\\nThe OWASP Top 10 focuses on identifying the most serious web application \\\\nsecurity risks for a broad array of organizations. For each of these risks, we \\\\nprovide generic information about likelihood and technical impact using the \\\\nfollowing simple ratings scheme, which is based on the OWASP Risk Rating \\\\nMethodology .\\\\nIn this edition, we have updated the risk rating system to assist in calculating the \\\\nlikelihood and impact of any given risk. For more details, please see Note About \\\\nRisks .\\\\nEach organization is unique, and so are the threat actors for that organization, \\\\ntheir goals, and the impact of any breach. If a public interest organization uses a \\\\ncontent management system (CMS) for public information and a health system \\\\nuses that same exact CMS for sensitive health records, the threat actors and \\\\nbusiness impacts can be very different for the same software. It is critical to \\\\nunderstand the risk to your organization based on applicable threat agents and \\\\nbusiness impacts.\\\\nWhere possible, the names of the risks in the Top 10 are aligned with Common \\\\nWeakness Enumeration (CWE) weaknesses to promote generally accepted \\\\nnaming conventions and to reduce confusion.Threat\\\\nAgentsExploitabilityWeakness \\\\nPrevalenceWeakness \\\\nDetectabilityTechnical \\\\nImpactsBusiness \\\\nImpacts\\\\nAppli -\\\\ncation \\\\nSpecificEasy: 3 Widespread: 3 Easy: 3 Severe: 3\\\\nBusiness \\\\nSpecificAverage: 2 Common :2 Average: 2 Moderate :2\\\\nDifficult: 1 Uncommon: 1 Difficult: 1 Minor: 1References\\\\nOWASP\\\\n•OWASP Risk Rating Methodology\\\\n•Article on Threat/Risk Modeling\\\\nExternal\\\\n•ISO 31000: Risk Management Std\\\\n•ISO 27001: ISMS\\\\n•NIST Cyber Framework (US)\\\\n•ASD Strategic Mitigations (AU)\\\\n•NIST CVSS 3.0\\\\n•Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool\\' metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 5},page_content=\"6\\\\nT10OWASP T op 10\\\\nApplication Security Risks –2017\\\\nInjection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent \\\\nto an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the \\\\ninterpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.\\\\nA1:2017 -\\\\nInjection\\\\nApplication functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented \\\\nincorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit \\\\nother implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently .\\\\nA2:2017 -Broken \\\\nAuthentication\\\\nMany web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, \\\\nhealthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit \\\\ncard fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra \\\\nprotection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when \\\\nexchanged with the browser.\\\\nA3:2017 -\\\\nSensitive Data \\\\nExposure\\\\nMany older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML \\\\ndocuments. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, \\\\ninternal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.\\\\nA4:2017 -XML \\\\nExternal \\\\nEntities (XXE)\\\\nRestrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. \\\\nAttackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access \\\\nother users\\' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.\\\\nA5:2017 -Broken \\\\nAccess Control\\\\nSecurity misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure \\\\ndefault configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured \\\\nHTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all \\\\noperating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must \\\\nbe patched and upgraded in a timely fashion.\\\\nXSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without \\\\nproper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user -supplied data using a \\\\nbrowser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the \\\\nvictim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to \\\\nmalicious sites.\\\\nA7:2017 -\\\\nCross -Site \\\\nScripting (XSS)\\\\nInsecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not \\\\nresult in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, \\\\ninjection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. \\\\nA8:2017 -\\\\nInsecure \\\\nDeserialization\\\\nComponents, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same \\\\nprivileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate \\\\nserious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known \\\\nvulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts. \\\\nA9:2017 -Using \\\\nComponents \\\\nwith Known \\\\nVulnerabilities\\\\nInsufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident \\\\nresponse, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, \\\\nand tamper, extract, or destroy data.

If you have to manage a large application portfolio, this task can be\\\\ndaunting.\\\\nTo help organizations and developers reduce their application security risks in a cost -effective manner, OWASP has \\\\nproduced numerous free and open resources that you can use to address application security in your organization. The \\\\nfollowing are some of the many resources OWASP has produced to help organizations produce secure web applications and \\\\nAPIs. On the next page, we present additional OWASP resources that can assist organizations in verifying the security of \\\\ntheir applications and APIs.\\\\nThere are numerous additional OWASP resources available for your use. Please visit the OWASP Projects page , which lists all the \\\\nFlagship, Labs, and Incubator projects in the OWASP project inventory. Most OWASP resources are available on our wiki, and \\\\nmany OWASP documents can be ordered in hardcopy or as eBooks .To produce a secure web application, you must define what secure means for that application. \\\\nOWASP recommends you use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) as a \\\\nguide for setting the security requirements for your application(s). If you’re outsourcing, consider \\\\nthe OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex . Note : The annex is for US contract law, so please \\\\nconsult qualified legal advice before using the sample annex. \\\\nRather than retrofitting security into your applications and APIs, it is far more cost effective to \\\\ndesign the security in from the start. OWASP recommends the OWASP Prevention Cheat Sheets\\\\nas a good starting point for guidance on how to design security in from the beginning. \\\\nApplication \\\\nSecurity \\\\nArchitecture\\\\nBuilding strong and usable security controls is difficult. Using aset of standard security controls \\\\nradically simplifies the development of secure applications and APIs. The OWASP Proactive \\\\nControls is a good starting point for developers, and m any modern frameworks now come with \\\\nstandard and effective security controls for authorization, validation, CSRF prevention, etc.\\\\nStandard \\\\nSecurity \\\\nControls\\\\nTo improve the process your organization follows when building applications and APIs, OWASP \\\\nrecommends the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) . This model helps \\\\norganizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the \\\\nspecific risks facing their organization. \\\\nThe OWASP Education Project provides training materials to help educate developers on web \\\\napplication security. For hands -on learning about vulnerabilities, try OWASP WebGoat , \\\\nWebGoat.NET , OWASP NodeJS Goat , OWASP Juice Shop Project or the OWASP Broken Web \\\\nApplications Project .

But it’s critical to verify that the security you intended to build is actually present, correctly \\\\nimplemented, and used everywhere it is supposed to be. The goal of application security testing is to provide this evidence. \\\\nThe work is difficult and complex, and modern high -speed development processes like Agile and DevOps have put extreme \\\\npressure on traditional approaches and tools. So we strongly encourage you to put some thought into how you are going to \\\\nfocus on what’s important across your entire application portfolio, and do it cost -effectively.\\\\nModern risks move quickly, so the days of scanning or penetration testing an application for vulnerabilities once every year or \\\\nso are long gone. Modern software development requires continuous application security testing across the entire software \\\\ndevelopment lifecycle. Look to enhance existing development pipelines with security automation that doesn’t slow \\\\ndevelopment. Whatever approach you choose, consider the annual cost to test, triage, remediate, retest, and redeploy a \\\\nsingle application, multiplied by the size of your application portfolio.\\\\n+T What’s Next for Security T esters\\\\nBefore you start testing, be sure you understand what’s important to spend time on. Priorities \\\\ncome from the threat model, so if you don’t have one, you need to create one before testing. \\\\nConsider using OWASP ASVS and the OWASP Testing Guide as an input and don’t rely on tool \\\\nvendors to decide what’s important for your business. \\\\nYour approach to application security testing must be highly compatible with the people, \\\\nprocesses, and tools you use in your software development lifecycle (SDLC). Attempts to force \\\\nextra steps, gates, and reviews are likely to cause friction, get bypassed, and struggle to scale. \\\\nLook for natural opportunities to gather security information and feed it back into your process.\\\\nChoose the simplest, fastest, most accurate technique to verify each requirement. The OWASP \\\\nSecurity Knowledge Framework and OWASP Application Security Verification Standard can be \\\\ngreat sources of functional and nonfunctional security requirements in your unit and integration \\\\ntesting. Be sure to consider the human resources required to deal with false positives from the \\\\nuse of automated tooling, as well as the serious dangers of false negatives.\\\\nTesting \\\\nStrategies\\\\nYou don’t have to start out testing everything. Focus on what’s important and expand your \\\\nverification program over time. That means expanding the set of security defenses and risks that \\\\nare being automatically verified as well as expanding the set of applications and APIs being \\\\ncovered. The goal is to achieve a state where the essential security of all your applications and \\\\nAPIs is verified continuously.\\\\nAchieving \\\\nCoverage\\\\nand \\\\nAccuracy\\\\nNo matter how good you are at testing, it won’t make any difference unless you communicate it \\\\neffectively. Build trust by showing you understand how the application works. Describe clearly \\\\nhow it can be abused without “lingo” and include an attack scenario to make it real. Make a \\\\nrealistic estimation of how hard the vulnerability is to discover and exploit, and how bad that \\\\nwould be.

We then ordered the Top 10 according to those weaknesses that \\\\ntypically introduce the most significant risk to an application. These factors get updated with each new Top 10 release as \\\\nthings change and evolve.\\\\nThe OWASP Risk Rating Methodology defines numerous factors to help calculate the risk of an identified vulnerability. \\\\nHowever, the Top 10 must talk about generalities, rather than specific vulnerabilities in real applications and APIs. \\\\nConsequently, we can never be as precise as application owners or managers when calculating risks for their application(s). \\\\nYou are best equipped to judge the importance of your applications and data, what your threats are, and how your system \\\\nhas been built and is being operated.\\\\nOur methodology includes three likelihood factors for each weakness (prevalence , detectability, and ease of exploit ) and one\\\\nimpact factor (technical impact). The risk scales for each factor range from 1 -Low to 3 -High with terminology specific for each \\\\nfactor. The prevalence of a weakness is a factor that you typically don’t have to calculate. For prevalence data, we have been \\\\nsupplied prevalence statistics from a number of different organizations (as referenced in the Acknowledgements on page 25), \\\\nand we have aggregated their data together to come up with a Top 10 likelihood of existence list by prevalence. This data \\\\nwas then combined with the other two likelihood factors (detectability and ease of exploit) to calculate a likelihood rating for\\\\neach weakness. The likelihood rating was then multiplied by our estimated average technical impact for each item to come up \\\\nwith an overall risk ranking for each item in the Top 10 (the higher the result the higher the risk). Detectability, Ease of Exploit, \\\\nand Impact were calculated from analyzing reported CVEs that were associated with each of the Top 10 categories. \\\\nNote : This approach does not take the likelihood of the threat agent into account. Nor does it account for any of the various \\\\ntechnical details associated with your particular application. Any of these factors could significantly affect the overall li kelihood \\\\nof an attacker finding and exploiting a particular vulnerability. This rating does not take into account the actual impact on your \\\\nbusiness . Your organization will have to decide how much security risk from applications and APIs the organization is willing \\\\nto accept given your culture, industry, and regulatory environment.

We put them into a ranked survey and asked respondents to \\\\nrank the top four vulnerabilities that they felt should be included in the OWASP Top 10 -2017. The survey was open from\\\\nAug 2 –Sep 18, 2017. 516 responses were collected and the vulnerabilities were ranked.\\\\nExposure of Private Information is clearly the highest -ranking vulnerability, but fits very easily as an additional emphasis int o \\\\nthe existing A3:2017 -Sensitive Data Exposure . Cryptographic Failures can fit within Sensitive Data Exposure. Insecure \\\\ndeserialization was ranked at number three, so it was added to the Top 10 as A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization after risk \\\\nrating. The fourth ranked User -Controlled Key is included in A5:2017 -Broken Access Control ; it is good to see it rank highly \\\\non the survey, as there is not much data relating to authorization vulnerabilities. The number five ranked category in the \\\\nsurvey is Insufficient Logging and Monitoring, which we believe is a good fit for the Top 10 list, which is why it has become\\\\nA10:2017 -Insufficient Logging & Monitoring . We have moved to a point where applications need to be able to define what \\\\nmay be an attack and generate appropriate logging, alerting, escalation and response.\\\\nPublic Data Call\\\\nTraditionally, the data collected and analyzed was more along the lines of frequency data: how many vulnerabilities were \\\\nfound in tested applications. As is well known, tools traditionally report all instances found of a vulnerability and humans \\\\ntraditionally report a single finding with a number of examples. This makes it very difficult to aggregate the two styles of \\\\nreporting in a comparable manner.\\\\nFor 2017, the incidence rate was calculated by how many applications in a given data set had one or more of a specific \\\\nvulnerability type. The data from many larger contributors was provided in two views. The first was the traditional frequency\\\\nstyle of counting every instance found of a vulnerability, while the second was the count of applications in which each \\\\nvulnerability was found in (one or more times). While not perfect, this reasonably allows us to compare the data from Human \\\\nAssisted Tools and Tool Assisted Humans. The raw data and analysis work is available in GitHub . We intend to expand on \\\\nthis with additional structure for future versions of the Top 10.\\\\nWe received 40+ submissions in the call for data, and because many were from the original data call that was focused on \\\\nfrequency, we were able to use data from 23 contributors covering ~114,000 applications. We used a one -year block of time \\\\nwhere possible and identified by the contributor. The majority of applications are unique, though we acknowledge the \\\\nlikelihood of some repeat applications between the yearly data from Veracode. The 23 data sets used were either identified \\\\nas tool assisted human testing or specifically provided incidence rate from human assisted tools. Anomalies in the selected \\\\ndata of 100%+ incidence were adjusted down to 100% max. To calculate the incidence rate, we calculated the percentage of \\\\nthe total applications there were found to contain each vulnerability type. The ranking of incidence was used for the \\\\nprevalence calculation in the overall risk for ranking the Top 10.\\\\n+DAT Methodology and Data\\\\nRank Survey Vulnerability Categories Score\\\\n1Exposure of Private Information (\\'Privacy Violation\\') [CWE -359] 748\\\\n2Cryptographic Failures [CWE -310/311/312/326/327] 584\\\\n3Deserialization of Untrusted Data [CWE -502] 514\\\\n4Authorization Bypass Through User -Controlled Key (IDOR* & Path Traversal) [CWE -639] 493\\\\n5Insufficient Logging and Monitoring [CWE -223 / CWE -778] 440\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 23},page_content=\\'24\\\\n+ACK Acknowledgements\\\\nAcknowledgements to Data Contributors\\\\nWe’d like to thank the many organizations that contributed their vulnerability data to support the 2017 update:\\\\nFor the first time, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full list of contributors is publicly available .\\\\nAcknowledgements to Individual Contributors\\\\nWe’d like to thank the individual contributors who spent many hours collectively contributing to the Top 10 in GitHub:\\\\nAnd everyone else who provided feedback via Twitter, email, and other means.\\\\nWe would be remiss not to mention that Dirk Wetter, Jim Manico , and Osama Elnaggar have provided extensive assistance. \\\\nAlso, Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence provided invaluable support in the writing of the new A8:2017 -Insecure \\\\nDeserialization risk .•ak47gen\\\\n•alonergan\\\\n•ameft\\\\n•anantshri\\\\n•bandrzej\\\\n•bchurchill\\\\n•binarious\\\\n•bkimminich\\\\n•Boberski\\\\n•borischen\\\\n•Calico90\\\\n•chrish\\\\n•clerkendweller\\\\n•D00gs\\\\n•davewichers\\\\n•drkknight•drwetter\\\\n•dune73\\\\n•ecbftw\\\\n•einsweniger\\\\n•ekobrin\\\\n•eoftedal\\\\n•frohoff\\\\n•fzipi\\\\n•gebl\\\\n•Gilc83\\\\n•gilzow\\\\n•global4g\\\\n•grnd\\\\n•h3xstream\\\\n•hiralph\\\\n•HoLyVieR•ilatypov\\\\n•irbishop\\\\n•itscooper\\\\n•ivanr\\\\n•jeremylong\\\\n•jhaddix\\\\n•jmanico\\\\n•joaomatosf\\\\n•jrmithdobbs\\\\n•jsteven\\\\n•jvehent\\\\n•katyanton\\\\n•kerberosmansour\\\\n•koto\\\\n•m8urnett\\\\n•mwcoates•neo00\\\\n•nickthetait\\\\n•ninedter\\\\n•ossie -git\\\\n•PauloASilva\\\\n•PeterMosmans\\\\n•pontocom\\\\n•psiinon\\\\n•pwntester\\\\n•raesene\\\\n•riramar\\\\n•ruroot\\\\n•securestep9\\\\n•securitybits\\\\n•SPoint42\\\\n•sreenathsasikumar•starbuck3000\\\\n•stefanb\\\\n•sumitagarwalusa\\\\n•taprootsec\\\\n•tghosth\\\\n•TheJambo\\\\n•thesp0nge\\\\n•toddgrotenhuis\\\\n•troymarshall\\\\n•tsohlacol\\\\n•vdbaan\\\\n•yohgakiANCAP•\\\\nAspect Security•\\\\nAsTech• Consulting\\\\nAtos•\\\\nBranding Brand•\\\\nBugcrowd•\\\\nBUGemot•\\\\nCDAC•\\\\nCheckmarx•\\\\nColegio• LaSalle \\\\nMonteria\\\\nCompany.com•\\\\nContextIS•Contrast Security•\\\\nDDoS.com•\\\\nDerek Weeks•\\\\nEasybss•\\\\nEdgescan•\\\\nEVRY•\\\\nEZI•\\\\nHamed•\\\\nHidden•\\\\n•I4 Consulting\\\\niBLISS• Segura n̤a& \\\\nInteli g̻encia\\\\nITsec• Security Services bv\\\\nKhallagh•\\\\nLinden Lab•\\\\nM. •Limacher IT \\\\nDienstleistungen\\\\nMicro Focus Fortify•\\\\nMinded Security•\\\\nNational Center for •\\\\nCyber Security \\\\nTechnology\\\\nNetwork Test Labs Inc.•\\\\nOsampa•\\\\nPaladion• NetworksPurpletalk•\\\\nSecure Network•\\\\nShape Security•\\\\nSHCP•\\\\nSofttek•\\\\nSynopsis•\\\\nTCS•\\\\nVantage Point•\\\\nVeracode•\\\\nWeb.com•\\' metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 24}' metadata={'start_index': 0}\n"

As our softwa re \\\\nbecomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The \\\\nrapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve \\\\nquickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this \\\\nOWASP Top 10.\\\\nA great deal of feedback was received during the creation of the OWASP Top 10 -2017, more than for any other equivalent \\\\nOWASP effort. This shows how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus how critical it is for \\\\nOWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of use cases.\\\\nAlthough the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to raise awareness amongst developers and managers, \\\\nit has become thede facto application security standard.\\\\nIn this release, issues and recommendations are written concisely and in a testable way to assist with the adoption of the \\\\nOWASP Top 10 in application security programs. We encourage large and high performing organizations to use the OWASP \\\\nApplication Security Verification Standard (ASVS) if a true standard is required, but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great \\\\nstart on the application security journey.\\\\nWe have written up a range of suggested next steps for different users of the OWASP Top 10, including What’s Next for \\\\nDevelopers , What’s Next for Security Testers , What’s Next for Organizations , which is suitable for CIOs and CISOs, and \\\\nWhat’s Next for Application Managers , which is suitable for application managers or anyone responsible for the lifecycle of \\\\nthe application.\\\\nIn the long term, we encourage all software development teams and organizations to create an application security program \\\\nthat is compatible with your culture and technology. These programs come in all shapes and sizes. Leverage your \\\\norganization\\'s existing strengths to measure and improve your application security program using the Software Assurance \\\\nMaturity Model .\\\\nWe hope that the OWASP Top 10 is useful to your application security efforts.

Two key differentiators from previous OWASP Top 10 \\\\nreleases are the substantial community feedback and extensive data assembled from dozens of organizations, possibly the \\\\nlargest amount of data ever assembled in the preparation of an application security standard. This provides us with \\\\nconfidence that the new OWASP Top 10 addresses the most impactful application security risks currently facing \\\\norganizations.\\\\nThe OWASP Top 10 -2017 is based primarily on 40+ data submissions from firms that specialize in application security and \\\\nan industry survey that was completed by over 500 individuals . This data spans vulnerabilities gathered from hundreds of \\\\norganizations and over 100,000 real -world applications and APIs. The Top 10 items are selected and prioritized according to \\\\nthis prevalence data, in combination with consensus estimates of exploitability, detectability, and impact.\\\\nA primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations about the \\\\nconsequences of the most common and most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic \\\\ntechniques to protect against these high risk problem areas, and provides guidance on where to go from here.\\\\nRoadmap for future activities\\\\nDon\\'t stop at 10 . There are hundreds of issues that could \\\\naffect the overall security of a web application as discussed \\\\nin the OWASP Developer\\'s Guide and the OWASP Cheat \\\\nSheet Series . These are essential reading for anyone \\\\ndeveloping web applications and APIs. Guidance on how to \\\\neffectively find vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs \\\\nis provided in the OWASP Testing Guide .\\\\nConstant change . The OWASP Top 10 will continue to \\\\nchange. Even without changing a single line of your \\\\napplication\\'s code, you may become vulnerable as new \\\\nflaws are discovered and attack methods are refined. \\\\nPlease review the advice at the end of the Top 10 in What\\'s \\\\nNext For Developers , Security Testers , Organizations , and \\\\nApplication Managers for more information.\\\\nThink positive . When you\\'re ready to stop chasing \\\\nvulnerabilities and focus on establishing strong application \\\\nsecurity controls, the OWASP Proactive Controls project \\\\nprovides a starting point to help developers build security \\\\ninto their application and the OWASP Application Security \\\\nVerification Standard (ASVS) is a guide for organizations \\\\nand application reviewers on what to verify.\\\\nUse tools wisely . Security vulnerabilities can be quite \\\\ncomplex and deeply buried in code. In many cases, the \\\\nmost cost -effective approach for finding and eliminating \\\\nthese weaknesses is human experts armed with advanced \\\\ntools. Relying on tools alone provides a false sense of \\\\nsecurity and is not recommended.\\\\nPush left, right, and everywhere . Focus on making \\\\nsecurity an integral part of your culture throughout your \\\\ndevelopment organization.

We received \\\\nmore than 40 responses to the call for data. For the first \\\\ntime, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full \\\\nlist of contributors is publicly available. We believe this is one \\\\nof the larger, more diverse collections of vulnerability data \\\\never publicly collected.\\\\nAs there are more contributors than space here, we have \\\\ncreated a dedicated page to recognize the contributions \\\\nmade. We wish to give heartfelt thanks to these \\\\norganizations for being willing to be on the front lines by \\\\npublicly sharing vulnerability data from their efforts. We hope \\\\nthis will continue to grow and encourage more organizations \\\\nto do the same and possibly be seen as one of the key \\\\nmilestones of evidence -based security. The OWASP Top 10 \\\\nwould not be possible without these amazing contributions.\\\\nA big thank you to the more than 500 individuals who took \\\\nthe time to complete the industry ranked survey.

We\\'ve completely refactored the \\\\nOWASP Top 10, revamped the methodology, utilized a new data call process, worked with the community, re -ordered our risks, re -\\\\nwritten each risk from the ground up, and added references to frameworks and languages that are now commonly used.\\\\nOver the last few years, the fundamental technology and architecture of applications has changed significantly:\\\\n•Microservices written in node.js and Spring Boot are replacing traditional monolithic applications. Microservices come with their \\\\nown security challenges including establishing trust between microservices , containers, secret management, etc. Old code never \\\\nexpected to be accessible from the Internet is now sitting behind an API or RESTful web service to be consumed by Single Page\\\\nApplications (SPAs) and mobile applications. Architectural assumptions by the code, such as trusted callers, are no longer va lid.\\\\n•Single page applications, written in JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React, allow the creation of highly modular \\\\nfeature -rich front ends. Client -side functionality that has traditionally been delivered server -side brings its own security cha llenges.\\\\n•JavaScript is now the primary language of the web with node.js running server side and modern web frameworks such as \\\\nBootstrap, Electron, Angular, and React running on the client.\\\\nNew issues, supported by data:\\\\n•A4:2017 -XML External Entities (XXE) is a new category primarily supported by source code analysis security testing tools\\\\n(SAST) data sets.\\\\nNew issues, supported by the community:\\\\nWe asked the community to provide insight into two forward looking weakness categories. After over 500 peer submissions, and \\\\nremoving issues that were already supported by data (such as Sensitive Data Exposure and XXE), the two new issues are:\\\\n•A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization , which permits remote code execution or sensitive object manipulation on affected platforms.\\\\n•A10:2017 -Insufficient Logging and Monitoring , the lack of which can prevent or significantly delay malicious activity and breach \\\\ndetection, incident response, and digital forensics.\\\\nMerged or retired, but not forgotten:\\\\n•A4-Insecure Direct Object References and A7-Missing Function Level Access Control merged into A5:2017 -Broken Access \\\\nControl .\\\\n•A8-Cross -Site Request Forgery (CSRF) ,as many frameworks include CSRF defenses , it was found in only 5% of applications.\\\\n•A10-Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards , while found in approximately 8% of applications, it was edged out overall by XXE.\\\\nOWASP Top 10 -2013 \\\\uf0e8 OWASP Top 10 -2017\\\\nA1 –Injection \\\\uf0e8 A1:2017 -Injection\\\\nA2 –Broken Authentication and Session Management \\\\uf0e8 A2:2017 -Broken Authentication \\\\nA3 –Cross -Site Scripting (XSS) \\\\uf0ee A3:2017 -Sensitive Data Exposure\\\\nA4 –Insecure Direct Object References [Merged+A7] ∪A4:2017 -XML External Entities (XXE) [NEW]\\\\nA5 –Security Misconfiguration \\\\uf0ee A5:2017 -Broken Access Control [Merged]\\\\nA6 –Sensitive Data Exposure \\\\uf0ec A6:2017 -Security Misconfiguration\\\\nA7–Missing Function Level Access Contr [Merged+A4]∪A7:2017 -Cross -Site Scripting (XSS)\\\\nA8 –Cross -Site Request Forgery (CSRF) \\\\uf0fd A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization [NEW, Community]\\\\nA9 –Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities \\\\uf0e8 A9:2017 -Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\\\\nA10 –Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards \\\\uf0fd A10:2017 -Insufficient Logging &Monitoring [NEW,Comm .]\\\\nRN Release Notes\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 4},page_content=\\'5\\\\nWhat Are Application Security Risks?\\\\nAttackers can potentially use many different paths through your application to do harm to your business or organization. Each\\\\nof these paths represents a risk that may, or may not, be serious enough to warrant attention.\\\\nSometimes these paths are trivial to find and exploit, and sometimes they are extremely difficult.

If you have to manage a large application portfolio, this task can be\\\\ndaunting.\\\\nTo help organizations and developers reduce their application security risks in a cost -effective manner, OWASP has \\\\nproduced numerous free and open resources that you can use to address application security in your organization. The \\\\nfollowing are some of the many resources OWASP has produced to help organizations produce secure web applications and \\\\nAPIs. On the next page, we present additional OWASP resources that can assist organizations in verifying the security of \\\\ntheir applications and APIs.\\\\nThere are numerous additional OWASP resources available for your use. Please visit the OWASP Projects page , which lists all the \\\\nFlagship, Labs, and Incubator projects in the OWASP project inventory. Most OWASP resources are available on our wiki, and \\\\nmany OWASP documents can be ordered in hardcopy or as eBooks .To produce a secure web application, you must define what secure means for that application. \\\\nOWASP recommends you use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) as a \\\\nguide for setting the security requirements for your application(s). If you’re outsourcing, consider \\\\nthe OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex . Note : The annex is for US contract law, so please \\\\nconsult qualified legal advice before using the sample annex. \\\\nRather than retrofitting security into your applications and APIs, it is far more cost effective to \\\\ndesign the security in from the start. OWASP recommends the OWASP Prevention Cheat Sheets\\\\nas a good starting point for guidance on how to design security in from the beginning. \\\\nApplication \\\\nSecurity \\\\nArchitecture\\\\nBuilding strong and usable security controls is difficult. Using aset of standard security controls \\\\nradically simplifies the development of secure applications and APIs. The OWASP Proactive \\\\nControls is a good starting point for developers, and m any modern frameworks now come with \\\\nstandard and effective security controls for authorization, validation, CSRF prevention, etc.\\\\nStandard \\\\nSecurity \\\\nControls\\\\nTo improve the process your organization follows when building applications and APIs, OWASP \\\\nrecommends the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) . This model helps \\\\norganizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the \\\\nspecific risks facing their organization. \\\\nThe OWASP Education Project provides training materials to help educate developers on web \\\\napplication security. For hands -on learning about vulnerabilities, try OWASP WebGoat , \\\\nWebGoat.NET , OWASP NodeJS Goat , OWASP Juice Shop Project or the OWASP Broken Web \\\\nApplications Project .

But it’s critical to verify that the security you intended to build is actually present, correctly \\\\nimplemented, and used everywhere it is supposed to be. The goal of application security testing is to provide this evidence. \\\\nThe work is difficult and complex, and modern high -speed development processes like Agile and DevOps have put extreme \\\\npressure on traditional approaches and tools. So we strongly encourage you to put some thought into how you are going to \\\\nfocus on what’s important across your entire application portfolio, and do it cost -effectively.\\\\nModern risks move quickly, so the days of scanning or penetration testing an application for vulnerabilities once every year or \\\\nso are long gone. Modern software development requires continuous application security testing across the entire software \\\\ndevelopment lifecycle. Look to enhance existing development pipelines with security automation that doesn’t slow \\\\ndevelopment. Whatever approach you choose, consider the annual cost to test, triage, remediate, retest, and redeploy a \\\\nsingle application, multiplied by the size of your application portfolio.\\\\n+T What’s Next for Security T esters\\\\nBefore you start testing, be sure you understand what’s important to spend time on. Priorities \\\\ncome from the threat model, so if you don’t have one, you need to create one before testing. \\\\nConsider using OWASP ASVS and the OWASP Testing Guide as an input and don’t rely on tool \\\\nvendors to decide what’s important for your business. \\\\nYour approach to application security testing must be highly compatible with the people, \\\\nprocesses, and tools you use in your software development lifecycle (SDLC). Attempts to force \\\\nextra steps, gates, and reviews are likely to cause friction, get bypassed, and struggle to scale. \\\\nLook for natural opportunities to gather security information and feed it back into your process.\\\\nChoose the simplest, fastest, most accurate technique to verify each requirement. The OWASP \\\\nSecurity Knowledge Framework and OWASP Application Security Verification Standard can be \\\\ngreat sources of functional and nonfunctional security requirements in your unit and integration \\\\ntesting. Be sure to consider the human resources required to deal with false positives from the \\\\nuse of automated tooling, as well as the serious dangers of false negatives.\\\\nTesting \\\\nStrategies\\\\nYou don’t have to start out testing everything. Focus on what’s important and expand your \\\\nverification program over time. That means expanding the set of security defenses and risks that \\\\nare being automatically verified as well as expanding the set of applications and APIs being \\\\ncovered. The goal is to achieve a state where the essential security of all your applications and \\\\nAPIs is verified continuously.\\\\nAchieving \\\\nCoverage\\\\nand \\\\nAccuracy\\\\nNo matter how good you are at testing, it won’t make any difference unless you communicate it \\\\neffectively. Build trust by showing you understand how the application works. Describe clearly \\\\nhow it can be abused without “lingo” and include an attack scenario to make it real. Make a \\\\nrealistic estimation of how hard the vulnerability is to discover and exploit, and how bad that \\\\nwould be. Finally, deliver findings in the tools development teams are already using, not PDF \\\\nfiles.\\\\nUnderstand \\\\nthe Threat \\\\nModel\\\\nUnderstand \\\\nYour \\\\nSDLC\\\\nClearly \\\\nCommunicate\\\\nFindings\\' metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 18},page_content=\"19\\\\nStart Your Application Security Program Now\\\\nApplication security is no longer optional.

Achieving application security requires many different parts of an organization to work together\\\\nefficiently, including security and audit, software development, business, and executive management.

Larger organizations should consider \\\\nimplementing a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) for this purpose .\\\\n•Establish an application security program and drive adoption. \\\\n•Conduct a capability gap analysis comparing your organization to your peers to define key\\\\nimprovement areas and an execution plan. \\\\n•Gain management approval and establish an application security awareness campaign for the \\\\nentire IT organization.\\\\nGet Started\\\\n•Identify the protection needs of your application portfolio from a business perspective. This \\\\nshould be driven in part by privacy laws and other regulations relevant to the data asset being \\\\nprotected. \\\\n•Establish a common risk rating model with a consistent set of likelihood and impact factors \\\\nreflective of your organization\\'s tolerance for risk. \\\\n•Accordingly measure and prioritize all your applications and APIs. Add the results to your CMDB. \\\\n•Establish assurance guidelines to properly define coverage and level of rigor required.\\\\nRisk Based \\\\nPortfolio \\\\nApproach\\\\n•Establish a set of focused policies and standards that provide an application security baseline for \\\\nall development teams to adhere to.\\\\n•Define a common set of reusable security controls that complement these policies and standards \\\\nand provide design and development guidance on their use.\\\\n•Establish an application security training curriculum that is required and targeted to different\\\\ndevelopment roles and topics.\\\\nEnable with \\\\na Strong \\\\nFoundation\\\\n•Define and integrate secure implementation and verification activities into existing development \\\\nand operational processes. Activities include threat modeling , secure design and design review , \\\\nsecure coding and code review , penetration testing , and remediation.\\\\n•Provide subject matter experts and support services for development and project teams to be \\\\nsuccessful.\\\\nIntegrate \\\\nSecurity \\\\ninto \\\\nExisting \\\\nProcesses\\\\n•Manage with metrics. Drive improvement and funding decisions based on the metrics and \\\\nanalysis data captured. Metrics include adherence to security practices and activities, \\\\nvulnerabilities introduced, vulnerabilities mitigated, application coverage, defect density by type \\\\nand instance counts, etc.\\\\n•Analyze data from the implementation and verification activities to look for root cause and \\\\nvulnerability patterns to drive strategic and systemic improvements across the enterprise.\\\\nLearn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements.\\\\nProvide \\\\nManagement \\\\nVisibility\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 19},page_content=\\'20\\\\nManage the Full Application Lifecycle\\\\nApplications belong to the most complex systems humans regularly create and maintain. IT management for an application \\\\nshould be performed by IT specialists who are responsible for the overall IT lifecycle of an application.

We then ordered the Top 10 according to those weaknesses that \\\\ntypically introduce the most significant risk to an application. These factors get updated with each new Top 10 release as \\\\nthings change and evolve.\\\\nThe OWASP Risk Rating Methodology defines numerous factors to help calculate the risk of an identified vulnerability. \\\\nHowever, the Top 10 must talk about generalities, rather than specific vulnerabilities in real applications and APIs. \\\\nConsequently, we can never be as precise as application owners or managers when calculating risks for their application(s). \\\\nYou are best equipped to judge the importance of your applications and data, what your threats are, and how your system \\\\nhas been built and is being operated.\\\\nOur methodology includes three likelihood factors for each weakness (prevalence , detectability, and ease of exploit ) and one\\\\nimpact factor (technical impact). The risk scales for each factor range from 1 -Low to 3 -High with terminology specific for each \\\\nfactor. The prevalence of a weakness is a factor that you typically don’t have to calculate. For prevalence data, we have been \\\\nsupplied prevalence statistics from a number of different organizations (as referenced in the Acknowledgements on page 25), \\\\nand we have aggregated their data together to come up with a Top 10 likelihood of existence list by prevalence. This data \\\\nwas then combined with the other two likelihood factors (detectability and ease of exploit) to calculate a likelihood rating for\\\\neach weakness. The likelihood rating was then multiplied by our estimated average technical impact for each item to come up \\\\nwith an overall risk ranking for each item in the Top 10 (the higher the result the higher the risk). Detectability, Ease of Exploit, \\\\nand Impact were calculated from analyzing reported CVEs that were associated with each of the Top 10 categories. \\\\nNote : This approach does not take the likelihood of the threat agent into account. Nor does it account for any of the various \\\\ntechnical details associated with your particular application. Any of these factors could significantly affect the overall li kelihood \\\\nof an attacker finding and exploiting a particular vulnerability. This rating does not take into account the actual impact on your \\\\nbusiness . Your organization will have to decide how much security risk from applications and APIs the organization is willing \\\\nto accept given your culture, industry, and regulatory environment. The purpose of the OWASP Top 10 is not to do this risk \\\\nanalysis for you.\\\\nThe following illustrates our calculation of the risk for A6:2017 -Security Misconfiguration .\\\\nApplication\\\\nSpecificExploitability\\\\nEASY: 3Prevalence\\\\nWIDESPREAD: 3Detectability\\\\nEASY: 3Technical\\\\nMODERATE: 2Business\\\\nSpecific\\\\n3 3\\\\nAverage\\\\n= 3.03\\\\n* 2\\\\n= 6.0\\\\n+R Note About Risks\\\\nImpactsThreat\\\\nAgents\\\\nAttack\\\\nVectors\\\\nSecurity\\\\nWeakness\\\\n\\' metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 21},page_content=\"22\\\\nTop 10 Risk Factor Summary\\\\nThe following table presents a summary of the 2017 Top 10 Application Security Risks, and the risk factors we have assigned \\\\nto each risk.

We put them into a ranked survey and asked respondents to \\\\nrank the top four vulnerabilities that they felt should be included in the OWASP Top 10 -2017. The survey was open from\\\\nAug 2 –Sep 18, 2017. 516 responses were collected and the vulnerabilities were ranked.\\\\nExposure of Private Information is clearly the highest -ranking vulnerability, but fits very easily as an additional emphasis int o \\\\nthe existing A3:2017 -Sensitive Data Exposure . Cryptographic Failures can fit within Sensitive Data Exposure. Insecure \\\\ndeserialization was ranked at number three, so it was added to the Top 10 as A8:2017 -Insecure Deserialization after risk \\\\nrating. The fourth ranked User -Controlled Key is included in A5:2017 -Broken Access Control ; it is good to see it rank highly \\\\non the survey, as there is not much data relating to authorization vulnerabilities. The number five ranked category in the \\\\nsurvey is Insufficient Logging and Monitoring, which we believe is a good fit for the Top 10 list, which is why it has become\\\\nA10:2017 -Insufficient Logging & Monitoring . We have moved to a point where applications need to be able to define what \\\\nmay be an attack and generate appropriate logging, alerting, escalation and response.\\\\nPublic Data Call\\\\nTraditionally, the data collected and analyzed was more along the lines of frequency data: how many vulnerabilities were \\\\nfound in tested applications. As is well known, tools traditionally report all instances found of a vulnerability and humans \\\\ntraditionally report a single finding with a number of examples. This makes it very difficult to aggregate the two styles of \\\\nreporting in a comparable manner.\\\\nFor 2017, the incidence rate was calculated by how many applications in a given data set had one or more of a specific \\\\nvulnerability type. The data from many larger contributors was provided in two views. The first was the traditional frequency\\\\nstyle of counting every instance found of a vulnerability, while the second was the count of applications in which each \\\\nvulnerability was found in (one or more times). While not perfect, this reasonably allows us to compare the data from Human \\\\nAssisted Tools and Tool Assisted Humans. The raw data and analysis work is available in GitHub . We intend to expand on \\\\nthis with additional structure for future versions of the Top 10.\\\\nWe received 40+ submissions in the call for data, and because many were from the original data call that was focused on \\\\nfrequency, we were able to use data from 23 contributors covering ~114,000 applications. We used a one -year block of time \\\\nwhere possible and identified by the contributor. The majority of applications are unique, though we acknowledge the \\\\nlikelihood of some repeat applications between the yearly data from Veracode. The 23 data sets used were either identified \\\\nas tool assisted human testing or specifically provided incidence rate from human assisted tools. Anomalies in the selected \\\\ndata of 100%+ incidence were adjusted down to 100% max. To calculate the incidence rate, we calculated the percentage of \\\\nthe total applications there were found to contain each vulnerability type. The ranking of incidence was used for the \\\\nprevalence calculation in the overall risk for ranking the Top 10.\\\\n+DAT Methodology and Data\\\\nRank Survey Vulnerability Categories Score\\\\n1Exposure of Private Information (\\'Privacy Violation\\') [CWE -359] 748\\\\n2Cryptographic Failures [CWE -310/311/312/326/327] 584\\\\n3Deserialization of Untrusted Data [CWE -502] 514\\\\n4Authorization Bypass Through User -Controlled Key (IDOR* & Path Traversal) [CWE -639] 493\\\\n5Insufficient Logging and Monitoring [CWE -223 / CWE -778] 440\" metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 23},page_content=\\'24\\\\n+ACK Acknowledgements\\\\nAcknowledgements to Data Contributors\\\\nWe’d like to thank the many organizations that contributed their vulnerability data to support the 2017 update:\\\\nFor the first time, all the data contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full list of contributors is publicly available .\\\\nAcknowledgements to Individual Contributors\\\\nWe’d like to thank the individual contributors who spent many hours collectively contributing to the Top 10 in GitHub:\\\\nAnd everyone else who provided feedback via Twitter, email, and other means.\\\\nWe would be remiss not to mention that Dirk Wetter, Jim Manico , and Osama Elnaggar have provided extensive assistance. \\\\nAlso, Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence provided invaluable support in the writing of the new A8:2017 -Insecure \\\\nDeserialization risk .•ak47gen\\\\n•alonergan\\\\n•ameft\\\\n•anantshri\\\\n•bandrzej\\\\n•bchurchill\\\\n•binarious\\\\n•bkimminich\\\\n•Boberski\\\\n•borischen\\\\n•Calico90\\\\n•chrish\\\\n•clerkendweller\\\\n•D00gs\\\\n•davewichers\\\\n•drkknight•drwetter\\\\n•dune73\\\\n•ecbftw\\\\n•einsweniger\\\\n•ekobrin\\\\n•eoftedal\\\\n•frohoff\\\\n•fzipi\\\\n•gebl\\\\n•Gilc83\\\\n•gilzow\\\\n•global4g\\\\n•grnd\\\\n•h3xstream\\\\n•hiralph\\\\n•HoLyVieR•ilatypov\\\\n•irbishop\\\\n•itscooper\\\\n•ivanr\\\\n•jeremylong\\\\n•jhaddix\\\\n•jmanico\\\\n•joaomatosf\\\\n•jrmithdobbs\\\\n•jsteven\\\\n•jvehent\\\\n•katyanton\\\\n•kerberosmansour\\\\n•koto\\\\n•m8urnett\\\\n•mwcoates•neo00\\\\n•nickthetait\\\\n•ninedter\\\\n•ossie -git\\\\n•PauloASilva\\\\n•PeterMosmans\\\\n•pontocom\\\\n•psiinon\\\\n•pwntester\\\\n•raesene\\\\n•riramar\\\\n•ruroot\\\\n•securestep9\\\\n•securitybits\\\\n•SPoint42\\\\n•sreenathsasikumar•starbuck3000\\\\n•stefanb\\\\n•sumitagarwalusa\\\\n•taprootsec\\\\n•tghosth\\\\n•TheJambo\\\\n•thesp0nge\\\\n•toddgrotenhuis\\\\n•troymarshall\\\\n•tsohlacol\\\\n•vdbaan\\\\n•yohgakiANCAP•\\\\nAspect Security•\\\\nAsTech• Consulting\\\\nAtos•\\\\nBranding Brand•\\\\nBugcrowd•\\\\nBUGemot•\\\\nCDAC•\\\\nCheckmarx•\\\\nColegio• LaSalle \\\\nMonteria\\\\nCompany.com•\\\\nContextIS•Contrast Security•\\\\nDDoS.com•\\\\nDerek Weeks•\\\\nEasybss•\\\\nEdgescan•\\\\nEVRY•\\\\nEZI•\\\\nHamed•\\\\nHidden•\\\\n•I4 Consulting\\\\niBLISS• Segura n̤a& \\\\nInteli g̻encia\\\\nITsec• Security Services bv\\\\nKhallagh•\\\\nLinden Lab•\\\\nM. •Limacher IT \\\\nDienstleistungen\\\\nMicro Focus Fortify•\\\\nMinded Security•\\\\nNational Center for •\\\\nCyber Security \\\\nTechnology\\\\nNetwork Test Labs Inc.•\\\\nOsampa•\\\\nPaladion• NetworksPurpletalk•\\\\nSecure Network•\\\\nShape Security•\\\\nSHCP•\\\\nSofttek•\\\\nSynopsis•\\\\nTCS•\\\\nVantage Point•\\\\nVeracode•\\\\nWeb.com•\\' metadata={\\'source\\': \\'./OWASP_Top_10-2017_(en).pdf.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 24}', metadata={'start_index': 0})"
